This package includes several functions that are handy when handling patent data, especially from the OECD Regpat database.

## Installation

You can install the current version of Pmisc like so:

``` r
devtools::install_github("PintarN/Pmisc")
```

## Documentation

At this point, there is no dedicated doc file. However, you can easily read a documentation 
for each function by accessing the "help" section of each function in your R IDE.
